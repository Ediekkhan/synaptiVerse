; REASONING RULES (For multi-hop traversal)
; Rule 1: If urgency=critical → recommend emergency services
; Rule 2: If confidence>0.9 AND urgency=critical → Call 911
; Rule 3: If multiple symptoms match cardiac + critical → immediate action
; Rule 4: Emergency patterns override all other diagnoses
; Rule 5: Combine symptom clusters for differential diagnosis
